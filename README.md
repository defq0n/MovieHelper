# Movie Helper
#### **A simple application to help users find a new movie to watch**
This web application was created CS4531 Software Engineering at the University
of Minnesota Duluth

The application is simple. When the user lands on the homepage, they are greeted
with information about the service, and have the option to log in or register an
account. Once the user is logged in, they will be brought to a web page allowing
them to enter parameterized search query for a type of movie. The query can be
left blank for a list of any movies. Each list item has a link to its own page,
where it will display the movie poster and trailer (if applicable), three of the
main actors in the film, along with a rating and comments from other users.
Users can visit their own profile, where they can view comments and ratings they
left on movies.

The service was built on the Java JSF framework, with CSS styling, and
SQL for database access.

Filling the movies database was a tedious task, a (semi-functional) web-scraper
was written to quickly populate the database. For our example, only around 50
movies were scraped and imported.
